How To Write A Good Commit Message.

When starting a new project, three things collaborators should agree on are:
	
	Style
	- Markup Syntax
	- Wrap Margins
	- Grammar
	- Capitalization
	- Punctuation

	Content
	- What information should the commit message body contain.
	- What should it not contain.

	Metadata
	- Issue tracking ID's?
	- Pull request numbers?
	- How will these things be referenced.

The seven rules of a great commit message:

	- Seperate the subject from the body with a blank line.
	- Limit the subject length to 50 characters.
	- Capitalize the subject line.
	- Do not end the subject with a period.
	- Use the imperative mood in the subject (The verb makes a command or request).
	- Wrap the body at 72 characters.
	- Use the body to explain WHAT and WHY instead of HOW.

Good things to remember:

	- Not every commit requires you to have a body. If changes are simple then keep things to one line.
